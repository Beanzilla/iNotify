An in-game notification system.

## Goals

- Allow players to see their position, health, and other information without F5.

- Now includes a interval in seconds till it updates.

- Allow players to share their information with other players. (todo)

- Now includes current world time and if requested also includes day count since starting world creation

- Uses settings defined in `minetest.conf`. (Just set them there or just run it once then change them, they will be automatically added to the `minetest.conf` file)

## Todo

- [x] Use the HUD to render a players position and other information (Completed: position, inventory space free, health)
- [ ] Allow players to share that information with other players.
- [ ] Allow shared information to be persistent. (In other words, you can share your info across server restarts and sessions)
- [x] Added MineClone support (Mainly MineClone5's multi-dimentions, but it appears MCL2 also is supported)
